# project-team3-L0101

Initial Plan: 

Our "Scrum Master" was a normal member of the team, except with a few added responsibilities. Firstly and most importantly, our Scrum Master planned meetings, considering the time and location constraints of individuals as well as time left for the project. For example, most of our team members had conflicting schedules, so our Scrum Master instead insisted that the group meet once a week electronically via Skype early in the morning for planning meetings. Our Scrum Master also frequently consulted individual team members outside meetings, taking and sharing notes about any important status updates (i.e. completion) as status updates were infrequent. This and the meetings meant that the Scrum Master was a note taker during meetings. These notes would be used during status meetings and updated as needed. Details were added since status meetings were more detailed and included progress and not just milestones. Tasks were sized based entirely on difficulty. A small sized task could be completed in an hour, medium sized task in less than a day and large tasks spanned over more than a day. During our initial planning meeting, our metrics for an easy task and difficult tasks were based entirely on estimates based on our abilities, as well as what each task encompassed. Our entire team, including the scrum master agreed on the size of the task by consensus, and little argument was raised over the size of the task. We also tried to start this sprint early instead of "crunching" it on the final week as we did with sprint 2. 


Last sprint, we planned and managed to get our P2P chat working with some connection issues. For this sprint, we were trying to implement our original MVP which was the implementation of the group chat feature of our application, while also perfecting the connection for P2P chat. Also, we wanted to enhance the appearance of our UI and make improvements to what seemed to be a very plain looking UI from the previous phase. After we complete our implementation of the group chat, the original MVP will mostly be fulfilled. However, that left us with the remaining user stories (recall phase 1) namely, user stories 1, 5, 6, 7, 8. We planned to implement as much as we could out of those features. We also planned on keeping conflicts on GitHub as minimum as possible and also being more organized in terms of tasking.

To be specific, we planned to accomplish the following:

1. Stable connection for P2P chat

2. Basic group chat

3. Store chat messages and retrieve later on

4. Store chat messages of a closed chat and retrieve when opened

5. Revamp UI to make it more visually appealing

6. Create UI for group chat.

Like the previous sprint, we divided our whole group in half to work on the back-end and the front-end. 

	* Front-end: improving the UI, fixing small bugs with the previous UI, improving appearance, adding a splash screen 
	- Sneh, Taras, Alex, Siddharth

	* Back-end: implementing the group chat 
	- Akshay, Priyen

At first, we were just planning on keeping our UI simple and adding color to enhance appearance. Later on, we decided that having tabs for "All Contacts", "Groups", "Favourites", and “Settings” would be more user friendly instead of having a separate intent for each of these. We also decided to add a splash screen to the start screen, which gives it a look similar to Facebook Messenger. 

Review and Retrospective:

The first week of this sprint wasn't very productive as all the group members had plenty of things on their plates. So like the previous sprint, we had to leave the work for the week after. This lack of progress led to a growth of backlog for the second week.

The second week was the week we completed many of the required tasks. The UI was changed, and we implemented the group chat. We had some trouble migrating the functionality that worked with the older UI to the newer UI which took some time to fix.

What went according to plan? 

* We managed to implement the group chat and stabilize P2P connection.

* The UI looks much better than before. 

* Before the start of this sprint, we made it a goal to avoid conflicts on GitHub by either stashing the changes or by communicating to the other group members. This worked according to plan and we did end up with fewer conflicts than the previous sprint.

* We decided to be more organized for this sprint because we wanted to avoid being confused and all over the place for our tasks. This sprint we all understood our strengths (strengths in coding, front-end, back-end, organization, etc) and we applied them accordingly. Hence, we had less confusion.


What didn't go according to plan?

* We didn't make much progress during the first week of this sprint! 

* We didn't get a chance to take a crack at user stories 1, 5, 6, 7, 8 and hence, we have left them for the final sprint. 
 
Improvements: 

1. As usual we couldn't get anything done during the first week. We really tried to improve on this from the previous sprint, however, we failed to accomplish this. It would help to ease the workload if the first week of the sprint is productive. We would like to really improve on this point. This should be made a major priority for the next and final sprint. 

2. MEETINGS! For this sprint, we only had a few meetings that involved all the group members. Last sprint, we did a great job of doing Skype meetings however, this did not work this time around. We wanted to keep the Skype meetings going, however due to the work load our group members had, the meetings were not done as we had expected. This could have been improved if we managed our time well.

What we should repeat: 

1. Like the previous sprint, group members were on the look out for each other. We helped each other out a lot whenever we got into tight situations. Some group members were taking initiative to achieve our goals for this sprint. When members were done with their task they tried to help the others with their tasks. This should be repeated in the final sprint and it's a good sign of team work! 

2. Conflicts on GitHub. We were really able to reduce the conflicts this time around. We felt much more comfortable with GitHub for this sprint, and it is because of this reason we weren't caught up with fixing many conflicts.

3. We completed our responsibilities based on our ability. We did not prioritize work that wasn't suitable for us in terms our of abilities. This created much less confusion and we were able to work efficiently.
