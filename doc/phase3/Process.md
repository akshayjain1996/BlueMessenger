# project-team3-L0101

After the second sprint, the group members participated in an in-person meeting that was held in order to discuss the steps that will be taken for this sprint. (Recap from Planning.md) Our primary issues included stabilizing the current connection between two devices, implementing group chat, and revamping the UI. We then decided to add the list of tasks as issues on github so that group members can work on them with ease at their own convenience. The issues were being constantly updated as the status of a task changed so that people could keep track of what was being worked on. This was the process used to collaborate and work in an organized manner. The tools that were used include Github, Android Studio, Android physical devices, Android virtual devices, Google Docs, Android Bluetooth API, Skype and Facebook (for online communication).


Sprint Backlog:

This time our group worked on various parts that were yet to be completed based on github issues. There was no specific assignment stating that a person needs to work on a particular section of code. Therefore, it was more open and people were allowed to contribute towards any incomplete section of the project and update the issue on github.

The order of tasks that were to be completed and the people who worked on them are as follows: 

1. Stabilize Current P2P connection - Priyen

2. Store chat messages(Using serializer learned in class) - Alex, Siddharth

3. Create UI for group chat - Taras, Sneh, Alex, Akshay

4. Visual appearence of UI - Sneh, Taras, Akshay, Alex

5. Implement backend for group chat - Akshay, Priyen, Alex

6. Test thoroughly - Everyone

7. Comment - Siddharth

Meeting notes:

* 4th November 2015 (In-Person): Decided the tasks to be added to the sprint backlog. Discussed various algorithms that could be used to implement group chat and to prevent cycle. We eventually concluded that we will fix problems with the group chat algorithm during the testing phase, as it would give us the best possible idea as to what could go wrong. No work done since last phase.

* 11th November 2015 (Facebook): Status meeting. We discussed the approach that will be used to work for this phase and that this time the team would not be divided, giving everyone the opportunity to work on any issue that was remaining. Basic work on group chat data structure began.

* 16th November 2015 (Facebook): Progress meeting to discuss how work is moving along and to fix any problems that people were having during the coding process. Basic structure not yet implemented, but UI idea for group chat decided.

* 22nd November 2015 (In-Person): This meeting was primarily held to test group chat using multiple devices and fix any issues on the spot. Group chat mostly finished; UI issues resolved; work on file transfer began.

* 22nd November 2015 (Facebook): This meeting was held to make sure that everything is fine with the report. Group members read through the google document and contributed to it.
